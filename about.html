Fruit Types and Classification of Fruits

Introduction

Although most of us have a good idea what fruits and vegetables are when we eat them, it would be difficult provide a definition for someone of just what makes one food a vegetable and another a fruit. For a botanist, the definitions are easier; a fruit is a reproductive structure of an angiosperm which develops from the ovary and accessory tissue, which surrounds and protects the seed. Fruits are important in seed dispersal. A vegetable is a part of one of the vegetative organs of the plant: roots, stems or leaves, or shoot systems. There are a few "vegetables which are difficult; broccoli and cauliflower are inflorescence buds, and artichokes are the entire inflorescence. Since flowers, the reproductive organ of the plant produce fruits and seeds, perhaps those vegetables which are inflorescences are more similar to fruits than they are vegetables. No matter what we call our nutritious dietary components, in botany what constitutes a fruit is straightforward, and this lab looks at the structure and classification of fruits.

The process of fertilization initiates both seed and fruit development. While seeds develop from the ovules, the ovary tissue undergoes a series of complex changes which result in the development of the fruit. Many fruits are "fleshy" and contain sugars which attract animals who then disperse the enclosed seeds to new locations. Other, non-fleshy, fruits use other mechanisms for seed dispersal. In some plants, fruits can develop without fertilization. This is called parthenocarpy, and such fruits are seedless. As the ovary develops into a fruit, its wall often thickens and becomes differentiated into three, more or less distinct, layers. The three layers together form the pericarp, which surrounds the developing seed or seeds.

The three fruit layers are:

• Exocarp, the outermost layer often consisting of only the epidermis

• Mesocarp, or middle layer, which varies in thickness

• Endocarp, which shows considerable variation from one species to another

Materials Required per pair of students and for Demonstration

• Fresh snap beans or garden peas. Other available legumes may be substituted.

• Dry and soaked corn grains

• Tomatoes, cranberries or grapes

• Peaches, plums, or cherries

• Apples, pears, or quinces

• In addition, an assortment of various kinds of fruits that are available should be available for demonstration. Dry and fleshy fruits of different types should be provided, as should aggregate and multiple fruits.

Exercise 1 Classifying Fruits

All fruits may be classified into three major groups on the basis of the number of ovaries and the number of flowers involved in their formation. The following outline includes most of the common types of fruits. A simple key to classifying fruits is provided here. Use these descriptions and the "Key to Fruit Types" provided to identify the types of fruits you will be observing in the lab.

- 2 -

A. Simple Fruits.

Simple fruits develop from a single matured ovary in a single flower. Accessory fruits have some other flower part united with the ovary.

1. Fleshy Fruits, pericarp fleshy at maturity

a. Berry, consisting of one or more carpels with one or more seeds, the ovary wall fleshy

(1) Pepo (an accessory fruit), a berry with a hard rind, the receptacle partially or completely enclosing the ovary

(2) Hesperidium, a specialized berry with a leathery rind

b. Drupe, a stone fruit, derived from a single carpel and containing (usually) one seed. Exocarp a thin skin

c. Pome (an accessory fruit), derived from several carpels, receptacle and outer portion. of pericarp fleshy, inner portion of pericarp papery or cartilaginous, forming a core

d. Hip (an accessory fruit), several separate carpels enclosed within the fleshy or semi-fleshy receptacle

2. Dry Fruits, pericarp dry at maturity

a. Dehiscent fruits, those which dehisce or split open when fully mature

(1) Follicle, composed of one carpel and splitting along a single suture

(2) Legume, composed of a single carpel and splitting along two sutures

(3) Capsule, composed of several carpels and opening at maturity in one of four ways:

(a) Along the line of carpel union (septicidal dehiscence)

(b) Along the middle of each carpel (loculicidal dehiscence)

(c) By pores at the top of each carpel (poricidal dehiscence)

(d) Along a circular, horizontal line (circumscissle dehiscence)

(4) Silique, composed of two carpels which separate at maturity, leaving a persistent partition between them

b. Indehiscent fruits, those which do not split open at maturity

(1 ) Achene or akene, a one-seeded fruit with the seed attached to the fruit at one point only

(2) Caryopsis or grain, a one-seeded fruit in which the seed is firmly attached to the fruit at all possible points

(3) Samara, a one- or two-seeded fruit with the pericarp bearing a wing like outgrowth. A modified achene

(4) Schizocarp, consisting of two carpels which at maturity separate along the midline into two one-seeded halves, each of which is indehiscent

(5) Loment, having several seeds, breaking into one-seeded segments at maturity

(6) Nut, a hard, one-seeded fruit, generally formed from a compound ovary, with the pericarp hard throughout

B. Aggregate Fruits.

Aggregate fruits consist of a number of matured ovaries formed in a single flower and arranged over the surface of a single receptacle. Individual ovaries are called fruitlets.

C. Multiple Fruits.

Multiple fruits consist of the matured ovaries of several to many flowers more or less united into a mass. Multiple fruits are almost invariably accessory fruits.

Modified Structures in Plants

Many shoot systems, both stems and leaves, have modifications for special purposes. The leaves of carnivorous plants are famous examples of modified structures which are used for trapping and digesting insects and other small organisms. Just for curiosity observe the many stem, leaf, and shoot modifications on display.

A. Common Underground Stems and Shoots

• Rhizomes Horizontal stems that grow at or below the soil surface.

• Tubers The tips of rhizomes, which become enlarged with the storage of food.

• Bulbs Large buds, each consisting of a small stem and numerous fleshy, storage leaves.

• Corms Stems that superficially resemble bulbs but consist mostly of stem tissue; the leaves are usually smaller and thinner (bractlike and papery) than those of bulbs.

B. Other Modified Stems

• Tendrils Modified aerial organs for climbing. (Leaves can also form tendrils)

• Runners

(Stolons) Creeping stems that grow horizontally on the soil surface and often give rise to new plants at the nodes.

• Thorns Modified twigs that grow in the axils of leaves; they sometimes are branched.

• Note: The epidermis of stems and leaves can also be very "thorny". Technically, the thorns on roses and blackberry bushes are modified epidermis cells, called prickles.

C. Specialized Leaves

• Bud scales Protect buds of woody plants.

• Spines Protection

• Plantlets Propagules which can form new plants.

• Showy bracts Leaves used to attract pollinating agents.

D. Carnivorous plants

Fruits, Spices, Survival Plants, and Poisonous Plants
Materials

1. As complete as possible representation of both dry and fleshy fruit types

2. Demonstration of as many spices as is feasible

3. Display of survival plants (either herbarium specimens

or live material) indicating how each plant is used 4. Display of poisonous plants (either herbarium

specimens or live material) with notes on toxicity

 

Some Suggested Learning Goals

1. Know how the various fruit types are distinguished from one another.

2. Know at least one or two representatives of each fruit type.

3. Learn which plant parts are used for specific purposes.

4. Know several representative survival plants, how they are used, and how the toxic plants poison humans.

Introduction

In this exercise you will be asked to classify a number of fruits and to know examples of each fruit type. You will also be asked to take notes on what plant parts are used to prepare the various spices on display, know how the sur­vival plants are used, and be able to give examples of com­mon poisonous plants.

A. Fruits
Fruits may be defined as mature ovaries, usually containing seeds. At maturity, the ovaries swell and become fleshy

("juicy"), or the ovary wall shrivels and becomes dry. The separation between dry and fleshy fruits is occasionally in­distinct, but most fruits are relatively easy to categorize in this regard. Dry fruits either release their seeds when the fruit splits at maturity, or the fruit wall layers adhere to the seeds within and remain until the seed germinates. In some instances, these fruit wall layers form wings that aid in dis­persal; such wings should not be confused with the wings of conifer seeds, which are merely extensions of the seed coat.

A mature fruit, such as a peach, has three identifiable regions in addition to the seed(s). The outermost region ("skin") is referred to as the exocarp. The innermost region (the pit in a peach) is called the endocarp; it usually sur­rounds the seed(s). The flesh between the exocarp and the endocarp is the mesocarp. In dry fruits, in particular, two or all three of the layers may be fused together and, collec­tively, are referred to as the pericarp. Some fruits, such as apples and strawberries, consist of other flower parts in ad­dition to the ovary or ovaries. For example, the calyx itself may become fleshy and comprise more extensive fruit tis­sue than the ovary that it surrounds. A fruit that consists of more than just the ovary is said to have accessory tissue or is called an accessory fruit.

The fruit key that follows gives you many of the pri­mary distinctions among the various kinds of fruits, but it is not completely practical unless you have more information about the flowers from which the fruits are derived. Your instructor will help you with whatever additional informa­tion is needed to arrive at the correct botanical classifica­tion for the displayed fruits.

Exercise 1 Classifying Fruits

All fruits may be classified into three major groups on the basis of the number of ovaries and the number of flowers involved in their formation. The following outline includes most of the common types of fruits. A simple key to classifying fruits is provided here. Use these descriptions and the "Key to Fruit Types" provided to identify the

How many carpels are involved in the formation of the peach? .

What part of the ovary wall is the rough, fuzzy skin? .

What part of the fruit forms the edible portion of the fruit? .

What part forms the stone or pit? .

How many seeds does this a drupe contain? .

Identify and label the drawing of a drupe.

 

E. The Pome: Apple (Crab apple, pear, or quince)

Examine the fruit of the apple. Find the fruit stalk or pedicel, and see whether you find near its upper end any scars that might mark the former location of the other flower parts. Examine the other end of the fruit. What are the small, pointed structures which you find there?

. How many of these structures are there? . Do you find any evidence of stamens? .

Does the pome develop from an epigynous or hypgynous flower? .

Examine the cross-section of an apple, noting the star-shaped core. What are the papery or cartilaginous structures found in this region? . How many of them are there? .

Is the pome a true fruit or an accessory fruit? .

Identify and label the drawings of the pome.

III. Identification of Miscellaneous Fruits
